- add offset and gain controls to every output to standardize the way that users send commands no matter which output they are sending a value to
- add an option to set an output as unipolar? or should the user commands only ever be values from 0.0 to 10.0?
- when there is an improper input the twitch server could send back a message to the twitch chat showing proper usage guide for this patch. in fact it would be kinda tricky but there may be reasons to have the vcv module POST a usage guide specific to it's state back to the twitch server which then forwards it back to real twitch chat
